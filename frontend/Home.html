  <h1 id="titel">Purpose of this project..</h1>

  <div class="square">
    <p>.  I chose this project mainly for the reason that this will be helping me to stay updated on the books i have read so far in the past year. It will be easy for me to keep things organized and simple. Since reading has always been my interest, i decided to go for something that will be useful to me in one way or another. This Project was created without the help of any Framework and i have used my own code. It was coded with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have clearly underestimated this Project, since I thought that this would be very easy and be done in a short time. I had to rewrite the code a few times and think a lot. But i also learned a lot of new things, like CORS for example or how to work with node servers and make get and post requests. <br>Thank you for reading, even though you didn't have to.</p>
